# Java Katas
This collection of Java katas is slowly growing as I normally do katas on Codewars (see my [Profile on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Dmnk28)). 
After quite some time of improving my Java skills there, I realised that, for getting more experience especially in object-oriented design, it would be better to practice the classical way without the (lovely) learning "framework" Codewars offers.
