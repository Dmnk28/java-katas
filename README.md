# Java Katas

Here you will find solutions of mine for some Java katas. 

This collection will be slowly growing as I normally do katas on Codewars (see my [Profile on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Dmnk28)). 
After quite some time of improving my Java skills there, I realised that, for getting more experience especially in object-oriented design, it would be better to practice the classical way without the (lovely) learning "framework" Codewars offers.

While I love Codewars for its lack of autocompletion (better to learn the API when there are no cheats available ;) ), it limits the amount of Files (and therefore public classes/interfaces). 
And the secure and efficient use of an IDE is good to practice as well. So this is where these Kata Collection kicks in my learning curriculum.
